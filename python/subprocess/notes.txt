Based on the video tutorial https://www.oreilly.com/learning/executing-an-external-command-in-python

1. 'subprocess' is module in Python standard library that is used to invoke an external program/command

2. There are 2 important methods in the module

   - subprocess.call()
   
    -- output is directed to STDOUT
   
   - subprocess.check_output()
   
    -- to capture the output into a variable
    
3. Arguments to the methods

  eg: 1. list files in a directory
  
      -- subprocess.call('ls')                # command as a string
      
      2. list files in a directory with some arguments for the 'ls' command
      
       -- subprocess.call(['ls', '-l'])       # command as a list of strings with the command and its arguments as elements of the list
       
      3. list files in a directory using wild cards
      
      -- subprocess.call('ls *py', shell=True)  # wildcards are specific to the shell, so the shell=True should be passed and allow the command 
         to execute in shell.

4. write the output from check_output() method into a file
